# Circle Tool ðŸ”µ

This is a simple Python "sidecar" application that calculates the geometric properties of a circle. It's designed to be called by a parent process (like our Tauri app) and communicates over standard input/output using JSON.

## How It Works

1.  The script enters an infinite loop, waiting for input.
2.  It reads a single line from `stdin`.
3.  It parses the line as a JSON object (e.g., `{"payload": {"radius": 10}, "metadata": {"center": {"x": 150, "y": 150}}}`).
4.  It uses the `calculator` module to compute the circle's area and perimeter.
5.  It formats the result as a JSON object.
6.  It prints the resulting JSON string to `stdout`, followed by a newline, to signal completion to the calling process.

## Setup & Build

This tool has no external runtime dependencies. You only need Python 3 and PyInstaller to build the executable.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the circle-tool directory
cd /path/to/your-project/circle-tool

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
